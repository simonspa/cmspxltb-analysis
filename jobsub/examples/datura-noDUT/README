Datura telescope without explicit DUT at different geometries
===================

This directory contains an example configuration for the Datura
telescope with six planes of Mimosa26 without DUT.

This example is based on a test beam campaign done in 2012/2013 at DESY.

Features of this configuration:
------------------------------

- Datura telescope with Mimosa26 sensors
- telescope alone, no DUT
- settings tuned for DESY testbeam (1-6 GeV electrons)


Known issues:
------------

- Analysis still in progress: very preliminary results only!
