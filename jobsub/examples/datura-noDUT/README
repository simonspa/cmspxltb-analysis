Datura telescope without explicit DUT, spacing 150mm
===================

This directory contains an example configuration for the Datura
telescope with six planes of Mimosa26 without DUT.

This example is based on a test beam campaign done in May 2012 at DESY.

A corresponding data sample can be found at:

Features of this configuration:
------------------------------

- Datura telescope with Mimosa26 sensors
- telescope alone, no DUT
- settings tuned for DESY testbeam (1-6 GeV electrons)


Known issues:
------------

- does not use the reference vector framework for identifying a sensor
  plane corresponding to a hit; therefore, planes are identified by
  their z-coordinate which could lead to problems if this
  configuration is used in geometries with overlapping sensor layers
  (in z)

- lacks an thorough analysis of the data, e.g. using telescope planes
  as DUT and determining the resolution
