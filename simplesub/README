EUTelescope job submission tool: *OBSOLETE* soon!
-------------------------------------------------
Previous EUTelescope versions shipped with two different job
submission programs: pysub and simplesub. From version 0.8 onwards, we
recommend to replace these tools in your analysis with jobsub. Jobsub
offers a similar workflow but gives much more flexiblity and control
than the previous programs.

See ../jobsub/README or http://eutelescope.web.cern.ch/content/job-submission
