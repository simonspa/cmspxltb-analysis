//!EUTelX0Processor Class
/*!This class is used to work out the radiation length of a Device Under Test (DUT). What follows will be a list of each function and a brief description of its functionality, as well as each variable and its purpose:
*Public functions:
*-newProcessor() is necessary in all Marlin processors and is not used by the rest of the class.
*-EUTelX0Processor() is the default constructor, it does nothing and is not used, instead we use init() to initialise the class
*-init() is used to initialise the class, this fills in all the appropriate parameters from the Marlin steering file, and initialises all internal variables to 0 or a sensible default value
*-processRunHead(LCRunHeader *run) is called for every run, currently does nothing in this class
*-processEvent(LCEvent *evt) is called for every event in a run, and this currently deduces a track (if one exists) and records this tracks residual. This is used later to work out a kink angle which is necessary for the calculation of a radiation length.
*-end() is called after all the events are finished running, and this cleans up all the variables, before calculating the value of the material budget (X0) from all the events.
*-booksHistos() fills all the relevant histograms each event.
*Private functions (Should be accessed only from within this class):
*-basicFitter(LCCollection *alignedHitCollection) fits tracks based on relative X and Y position between two layers, if they are within a radius of each other determined by _cutValue1 then they are considered a track
*-calculateX0() is called in end() and is used to work out the value for the average radiation length in the material, this is the most important function in this processor
*-testtrack(LCCollection *trackCollection) is used if a fitting processor is used before teh X0 Processor and therefore no fitting is done in X0. This function just prints out all the values from the tracks as a test that they are working 
*-threePointResolution(LCCollection *alignedHitCollection) is a simple fitting algorithm that uses planes i and i+2 and takes the average x and y values to compare residuals against the actual values in plane i+1
*-createResiduals(LCCollection *trackCollection) this function creates the residuals from the basicFitter function
