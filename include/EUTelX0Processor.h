//!EUTelX0Processor Class
/*!This class is used to work out the radiation length of a Device Under Test (DUT). What follows will be a list of each function and a brief description of its functionality, as well as each variable and its purpose:
*Public functions:
*-newProcessor() is necessary in all Marlin processors and is not used by the rest of the class.
*-EUTelX0Processor() is the default constructor, it does nothing and is not used, instead we use init() to initialise the class
*-init() is used to initialise the class, this fills in all the appropriate parameters from the Marlin steering file, and initialises all internal variables to 0 or a sensible default value
*-processRunHead(LCRunHeader *run) is called for every run, currently does nothing in this class
*-processEvent(LCEvent *evt) is called for every event in a run, and this currently deduces a track (if one exists) and records this tracks residual. This is used later to work out a kink angle which is necessary for the calculation of a radiation length.
*-end() is called after all the events are finished running, and this cleans up all the variables, before calculating the value of the material budget (X0) from all the events.
*-booksHistos() fills all the relevant histograms each event.
*-guessSensorID(const double *pos) is used to deduce which layer of the pixel telescope each hit was in, and it uses the GEAR file provided to do this (as well as the parameter refhit)
*Private functions (Should be accessed only from within this class):
*-basicFitter(LCCollection *alignedHitCollection) fits tracks based on relative X and Y position between two layers, if they are within a radius of each other determined by _cutValue1 then they are considered a track
*-calculateX0() is called in end() and is used to work out the value for the average radiation length in the material, this is the most important function in this processor
*-testtrack(LCCollection *trackCollection) is used if a fitting processor is used before teh X0 Processor and therefore no fitting is done in X0. This function just prints out all the values from the tracks as a test that they are working 
*-threePointResolution(LCCollection *alignedHitCollection) is a simple fitting algorithm that uses planes i and i+2 and takes the average x and y values to compare residuals against the actual values in plane i+1
*-createResiduals(LCCollection *trackCollection) this function creates the residuals from the basicFitter function

  firstLayer and secondLayer inform the user in which two layers the extrapolation is being made. It is important that you get the order the right way around for the extrapolation.

But if going from layers 3 and 4 to 2 then the extrapolation is in the opposite direction and so firstLayer = 4 and secondLayer = 3.
