README: GeneralBrokenLines cmake compilation/installation
Version 24.September 2012

Requirements:
To build the code, you need to have CMake and root installed on your system.

Build procedure:
If you've already worked with CMake, the following steps should be known. 
The build philosophy is to encourage out-of-source builds, but this is not enforced.

Execute the following steps:
  1) create a compilation directory, e.g. 'build' and change into it
	mkdir build; cd build
  2) create the Makefile by invoking cmake on the configuration file (similar to the usual ./configure step of autotools)
	cmake ..
  3) start the build process
	make
As a result of successful compilation, the shared library will be created in the lib/ sub directory, and the executable example can be found in bin/.

Installation:
If you want to use the General Broken Lines as a project in another CMake managed project, or want (slightly) simpler path also invoke:
  make install
This will create some configuration files for inclusion and also create the lib/ and bin/ directory in the directory of the source code.
(You can also install the library in /usr/lib if wanted, this needs a slight modification of the CMakeLists.txt file.) 

Documentation:
To build the documentation, you need doxygen (version > 1.7.0 recommended ) on your system.
Invoke, also in the build directory:
  make doc

All steps in one:
The shortest way to build everything, if you have the required packages installed (CMake, root and doxygen) is to execute from the current (project root) directory (e.g. copy and execute the following line):
	mkdir build; cd build; cmake ..; make; make doc; make install
