********
IN THE FUTURE, this directory will contain well-documented examples 
that can be used as a base for your own analysis.
HOWEVER, THE CURRENT EXAMPLES ARE MAINLY TEST-CASES.
WE ENCOURAGE YOU THEREFORE TO START WITH FRESH STEERING FILES 
AND COMMIT YOUR ANALYSIS BACK TO US FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.
********

This subdirectory contains example configurations and steering files:

* datura-alone
     The Datura telescope with six planes of Mimosa26 without DUT

* anemone-2FEI4
     The Anemone telescope (six planes of Mimosa26) and 2 ATLAS-FEI4 pixel

All examples are also being used for automated data-driven tests using
the CMake/CTest framework to verify the correct functionality of
EUTelescope; see 'datura-alone/testing.cmake' for an example setup for
such a test.

All examples are self-contained and only refer to other files within
their subfolders (with the exception of the raw data files).

If you want to add your configuration as an example for others and as
basis for automated and constant verification, you need to provide the
necessary steering-files together with a data sample and
documentation. Please contact the EUTelescope software coordinators
for further information.
